    <content type="text"><![CDATA[About me(Ph.D.) I am studying at Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning. Advised by Prof. Jing Sui. (M.E.) Advised by Prof. Zhongyu li, Dr.Bin Kong. I majored in software engineering. I have published a journal paper in Neurocomputing with the first author and a conference paper in MICCAI with the third author. I participated in the scientific research of two medical artificial intelligence companies as an internship student. The research includes image segmentation, ultrasound video classification. In the meantime, I also have rich experience in engineering projects. InterestsEducation🤖️Embodied AI👨‍⚕️Bioinformatics🔥Deep Learning⚙️Machine Learning🧠Neuroimaging Analysis🎓Ph.D. in Beijing Normal University, 2022-PresentState Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning🎓M.E. in Xi’an JiaoTong University, 2019-2022Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering News 📖 2023/03 A paper abstract has been accepted for a poster presentation during the 2023 OHBM Annual Meeting. 📖 2022/06 The collaborative paper was published in MICCAI2022. 📖 2021/08 Got one paper about the rubustness evaluation of segmentation model accepted by Neurocomputing 2021. 2020/12 Joined Frontline Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. as an algorithmic intern. 2020/06 Joined Shenzhen Keya Medical Co., Ltd. as an algorithmic intern. Publications Key-frame Guided Network for Thyroid Nodule Recognition using Ultrasound VideosYichen Wang, Zhongyu Li, Xiangxiang Cui, et al. In MICCAI 2022 DEAttack: A differential evolution based attack method for the robustness evaluation of medical image segmentation. Xiangxiang Cui, Shi Chang, Chen Li, Bin Kong, Lihua Tian, Hongqiang Wang, Peng Huang, Meng Yang, Yenan Wu, Zhongyu Li. In Neurocomputing 2021, IF:5.779. Paper Research experiences Ultrasound Video ClassificationFeature extraction of multiple consecutive video frames based on CNN and LSTM.The verification accuracy of video-based(Our) classification is higher than single-frame classification.This research was done in the Frontline Intelligent Technology Internship. Head and Neck SegmentationLabel Data Preparation: using regional growth and optical flow to generate pre-segmentation. The Label specialists manually revised pre-segmentation.Deep Learning: using label data and 3D CNN to generate smooth segmentation results.This research was done in the ShenZhen Keya Medical Intership. Coronary SegmentationUsing CNN to segment the aorta, analyse the aorta segmentation results and then adjust algorithmic to adapt to different hospital datasets.Participating in the refinement of coronary segmentation, including vessel broken, vein removal.Develop vessel segmentation results evaluation tools to improve iterative efficiency.This research was done in the ShenZhen Keya Medical Intership. Engineering experiences Multi-User Server ManagementDeep learning, Docker environment configuration, system installation and problem fixes.Multi-user data privacy protection. Each user has separate account access. Users are also grouped by project, and folders cannot be accessed between different groups.Configure Remote Desktop Program so that every user can remotely access the remote desktop. Configure intranet penetration programs to ensure that the intranet can be accessed by external network programs under special circumstances.As a server administrator in the tutor lab of Xi’an Jiaotong University. Dance RobotThe robot consists of rudder, and motion instructions are issued by the microcomputer system through a serial port.For the coordination and smoothness of the dance, we carefully design the dance moves and use the data structure to coordinate the control action set. Web Online CompilerThe whole system is completed by using Html, Javascript, Php, Linux shell, Mysql.Support languages: C, C++, C#, Java, Html, Javascript, Php. The Embedded CarThe whole system is completed by using microsystem STM32, Cortex-A8 and C language.Using KNN to identify direction(turn to left or right) based on the Opencv library.Using PID algorithm and sensor to control the travel stability of the embedded car. Union SearchBased on JS, HTML to implement multiple search engine(such as: google/bing/baidu.) split-screen results display.This program is simple, but very practical, once online for a while. Algorithm Greedy Snakes GameDesign the game interface and develop intelligent snake algorithms using C++/CLR Library.Based on the traditional greedy snake algorithms, our algorithm takes food as the target and takes artificially controlled snakes as an obstacle to make path planning. In the end, the winning rate of the algorithm snake exceeds 70%. Compus Today Android APPRealize the functions of BBS forum, news and information download, etc.This project participated in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for Chinese College Students. Electronic Labeling SystemsThe whole system is completed by using microsystem STM32, Wireless hardware module, Ajax, C, HTML, LWIP Network Protocol, ESP8266 module, HTTP Server.Electronic labeling systems can be used in warehouses. The flow is sent from the web, via the wireless network module to the digital display, when the warehouse personnel completes the corresponding order, press the button of the electronic label, and finally the web will show that the task is complete.]]></content>
